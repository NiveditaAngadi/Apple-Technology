Let's discuss features and frameworks that introduced in the iOS 18. 

1. Swift Testing 
Swift Testing is a new framework with a new and refreshing approach to testing. 
Swift Testing contains modern features such as macros, which work with structs instead of classes and can tag tests and test suites. 

Swift Testing is available from iOS 18 and requires Xcode 16, meaning you can use it to test your Swift code on iOS 18 and later versions. 

@Test("Test view model increment function", .enabled(if: AppSettings.CanDecrement), 
   .tags(.critical))
func testViewModelIncrement() async throws {
// Preparation
let viewmodel = CounterViewModel() 
viewmodel.count = 5 

// execution 
viewmodel.increment(by: 1)

// verification 
#expect(viewmodel.count == 6) 
}

2. SwiftData 
SwiftData was introduced in WWDC 2023, as part of iOS 17, and its goal was to replace old but popular Core Data framework. 

SwiftData provides a modern API based on Swift, which can help reduce friction when working with persistent stores. 

Data model 
@Model 
class Book {
 var author: String 
 var title: String 
 var publishedDate: Date 
}

Relationships 
Deletion Rules 

iOS 18 introduces 
a. Unique value. 
Ability to construct  a unique value for the model based on its attributes. 
#Unique<Book>([\.name, \.publicationName])

b. History API 
Using History API, we can fetch transactions and changes that have been made to our Swift Datastore over a particular time range. This capability
allows us to update our app when we work with extensions such as widgets or sync changes to the server. 

c. Custom data stores to SwiftData 
For example, We start by creating a new data store configuration specifically for CSV data stores. 

3. Zoom transition 
In iOS 18, Apple added a new transition that allows us to navigate to a new view using a zoom animation. 

4. Adding floating tab bar 
In iPadOS18, the position of the sidebar can be adapted to side and top, using the tabViewStyle (.sidebarAdaptable)

5. More control over scroll views. 
Why is handling scroll views in SwiftUI more complex than in UIKit?
1. SwiftUI is relatively new: SwiftUI is still considered to be a new framework. 
2. Flexibility: Due to the imperative approach, UIKit gives us direct control over views. This means that we can adjust particular view parameters based
on the scroll state. 
SwiftUI's declarative nature sometimes makes achieving the same level of control challenging - we don't have direct access to views. 
We can adjust their state using a @State variable or a view modifier. 

onScrollGeometryChange - view modifier that allows us to observe any change in the scroll position. 

6. Observing item's visibility 
by -> onScrollVisibilityChange 

7. TextRenderer 
A protocol that can help us change the default behavior of our texts in SwiftUI.
