Supporting multiple languages in your app

1. To make your app multilingual, 
The first step to making your app multilingual is to internationalize your code to handle different languages and regional conventions.
you first need to internationalize it. This process involves preparing assets in your app so that 
a localizer can translate them into different languages and regional conventions. 
For example, dates in some countries appear in a day-month-year format, while in others, the month comes first.

2. After you internationalize your app, you need to localize it. 
Localization is the process of translating your assets into other languages for various regions.
During this process, you export the relevant strings and other resources from your app, 
and give them to a localizer for translation. 
The localizer gives you back translated versions of your assets, which you import into your app.
You then test the translations in your app to make sure everything works.
