Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)

1. What is VoIP?
Technology that allows users to make phone calls and video conferences over the internet instead of traditional phone line. 

VoIP is also known as IP telephony. 

2. What are the advantages of VoIP?
1. Cost: VoIP is often cheaper than traditional phone calls.
2. Flexibility: VoIP is more flexible than landlines, and it'e easier to add lines. 
3. Features: VoIP plans often include features like auto-attendant, call queuing, and conference calls.

3. Disadvantages of VoIP?
Internet Connection: VoIP is dependent on a reliable internet connection and power source.
Cyber attacks: VoIP is vulnerable to cyber attacks, unlike landlines.
Service disruptions: VoIP is vulnerable to service disruptions. 

4. SDK's which helps to implement the VoIP in iOS.
1. PushKit 
2. CallKit 
3. AVAudioSession 

1. PushKit: APIs that allows an app to receive pushes (notifications when data is available) from a remote server. 
Whenever a push is received, the app is called to action. For example, a VoIP app could display an alert when a call is received, 
and provide an option to accept or reject the call. It could even begin taking precursory steps to initiate the call, in the event the user decides to accept.\

PushKit VoIP support is available in iOS 8 and later.

Handles VoIP push notifications, enabling the app to wake up for incoming calls, even when it’s in the background.

2. CallKit: Manages the call UI, allowing your VoIP app to integrate with the native phone experience
The CallKit framework provides a familiar, native interface for handling calls in your VoIP app. 
It makes your app look and behave like the standard phone app, allowing you to display incoming and outgoing calls using the same UI.

3. AVAudioSession: Manages audio playback and recording, essential for controlling the audio input/output during VoIP calls.
To ensure that audio is handled properly during calls, you’ll need to configure AVAudioSession. 
This framework lets you manage audio routing and control the microphone and speaker settings for voice communication.
